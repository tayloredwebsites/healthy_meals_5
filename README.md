## Installation

### 1) fork and clone repo(sitory) from github


    # cd <your_projects_parent_directory>

see: [Fork a Github Repo](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo)

see: [Clone a Github Repo](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository)

    #confirm you are in your projects parent directory
    $ pwd #confirm you are in your projects parent directory
    $ git clone git@github.com:<yourGithubUsername>/healthy_meals.git
    $ cd healthy_meals
    $ git remote add upstream git@github.com:tayloredwebsites/healthy_meals.git

###  2) Installation of ASDF

    $ cat .tool-versions
      # you should see (with possible version differences):
      #    python 3.12.6
      #    direnv 2.34.0

### 3) installation of venv and direnv (working with asdf)

see: # [https://mdaverde.com/posts/python-venv-direnv-asdf/](https://mdaverde.com/posts/python-venv-direnv-asdf/)

    $ cd <code folder>
    $ cd healthy_meals  # see clone repo from github
    $ python -m venv .venv
    $ echo "export VIRTUAL_ENV=$PWD/.venv\nexport PATH=$PWD/.venv/bin:\$PATH" > .envrc
      # you should get: error ... .envrc is blocked. Run `direnv allow` to approve its content
    $ direnv allow
    $ which python3
      # you should see python3 3 running from the .venv directory
      #   .../healthy_meals/.venv/bin/python3
    $ cd ..
    $ cd healthy_meals
      # you will see the following messages entering your directory
      #   direnv: loading .../.envrc
      #   direnv: export +VIRTUAL_ENV ~PATH

### 4) install required software into .venv

    $ pip install -r requirements.txt

### 5) install postgres locally

Note: you may skip this step if you will be only using docker.

for brew install on mac: [https://daily-dev-tips.com/posts/installing-postgresql-on-a-mac-with-homebrew/](https://daily-dev-tips.com/posts/installing-postgresql-on-a-mac-with-homebrew/)

for other installs: [https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs/supported-open-source/postgresql/installing/](https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs/supported-open-source/postgresql/installing/)


Note: If you are having problems with installing postgres onto your computer, consider using docker desktop


### 6) install docker desktop

Note: You may skip this step if you are only developing locally, or have the Docker Daemon installed already.

### 7) install dart sass

Note: the libsass used by many python programs has been deprecated and dart-sass is now recommended

See: [https://sass-lang.com/blog/libsass-is-deprecated/](https://sass-lang.com/blog/libsass-is-deprecated/)

see: [https://github.com/sass/dart-sass](https://github.com/sass/dart-sass)

See: [https://sass-lang.com/install/](https://sass-lang.com/install/)

#### Mac

    % brew install sass/sass/sass
    % sass --version

#### Linux (using Snap)

See: [https://snapcraft.io/dart-sass](https://snapcraft.io/dart-sass)

    $ sudo snap install dart-sass
    % sass --version

#### docker

Note: Dockerfile now downloads dart-sass and adds it to the path

## Next Steps

### Base (Starter) Project Possible Enhancements
- Internationalization (i18n) of strings in database
- Static typing checks with MyPy
- Sphinx documentation tool
- HTMX ?
- Other enhancements ?

### Start Application Coding

#### 1) References Table

- This table will be designed to be able to have foreign key access to the references behind any particular piece of data or information on the site

#### 2) Consumables Table
